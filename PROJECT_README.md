## Usage

### Viewing Notifications
- Click the **notification bell** (top-right) to open the notification center
- **Active notifications** appear as toast messages on the left side
- **Critical notifications** have special animations and styling

### Managing Notifications
- **Mark as read**: Click the checkmark button
- **Dismiss**: Click the X button
- **Filter by category**: Use the filter buttons in the notification center
- **Clear all**: Use the filter icon in the notification center header

### Demo Features
- **Notification Simulator**: Use the controls (bottom-left) to generate random notifications
- **Start/Stop**: Control automatic notification generation
- **Reset**: Clear all notifications and reload sample data

## Technical Implementation

### Priority Algorithm
Notifications are scored based on multiple factors:
- **Priority Level** (1-6)
- **Relevance** (1-10)
- **Consequence** (1-10)
- **Recency** (1-10)
- **Time Phase Bound** (1-10)

### State Management
- React Context API for global notification state
- useReducer for complex state updates
- TypeScript for type safety

### Styling
- Styled-components for component-scoped CSS
- Gradient backgrounds and modern UI elements
- Responsive design principles
- Accessibility considerations

## Data Source

The notification data is based on the provided CSV file containing:
- 42 different notification scenarios
- Real-world inflight entertainment use cases
- Priority scoring and categorization
- Comprehensive trigger conditions

## Future Enhancements
